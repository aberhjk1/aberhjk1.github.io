<h1> Reflective essay</h1>

Moving from project one to project two was always going to be a step up, the motivation to ensure that I graduate was always in the front of my mind. I started off the semester ready to roll, having such a successful first semester of project gave myself a great starting point to project two and I was ready to push myself, be proud of the my level of work, and the professionalism I had achieved during the course of project and the degree as a whole.
The project two structure varied quite differently to that of project one where there was more emphasise on individual learning. This was quite different to the usual marking breakdown I had encountered during the degree but nonetheless I was prepared to get it done.
During the break between semester one and semester two I was offered a job at Agility CIS in Auckland as a Junior Analyst Developer. This alleviated a lot of stress which comes with finding a job for the end of the degree and allowed me to fully focus my time on achieving a high level of work during the duration of the second semester. In saying that, with the acceptance of the job came a few other stresses, such as trying to sort out the whole moving process and finding accommodation in Auckland. Also with having accepted the job, this meant that there was no way I slack off in any way, shape or form as part of the deal with accepting a graduate’s position is that you must graduate.
Having accrued the skills I had during project one and the degree really helped separate me from the other candidates for the role I am about to take. The ability to talk confidently about my programming abilities in a .NET environment, my knowledge of databases and my ability to work in an agile workflow within a team was truly a differentiator from other candidates and I am truly grateful for the knowledge I have received during the duration of this degree and project.

The first week of project saw the group expand with the addition of the project one students, having had such a tight knit group from the previous semester I did find it hard at first to adapt to the change of size and level of technical proficiency between the project 1 members and project 2 members. Having the ability to adapt to different situations is something I have been putting a lot more effort into this semester and believe that I have grown from the changes. Allowing myself to not only focus on my own personal studies but help others when they have questions and provide any knowledge that may help them has been really good for my growth.
Throughout this project 2 semester I have had the chance to do a lot of pair programming, I truly believe that the best code and most efficient way of achieving sprint tasks is to pair program. The ability to exchange ideas and thoughts about code as its being written has helped me enormously throughout the last semester, it allowed us to be on the same page and agree on what was working and what wasn’t. I started the pair programming with Matt Tucker as we undertook the creation of the ASP.net Web API part of Pathmapper. This started off by the creation of the SQL Database which would be used to talk with the API which could then be used by any application, in our case, the Pathmapper Android Application. Both having taken OOSD, web three and DB2 we had a fair idea of how to tackle the problem, ensuring that the database was scalable and in third normal form. Taking the knowledge from OOSD when making an API using ASP.net MVC we started by creating a simple GET request to get all the data we had in the database. It wasn’t too long before we ran into our first issue, when working with the ASP.net Project we had real issues with running the solution on two different computers as the nugget package manager would complain that either my computer was missing packages or Matts’ computer was missing packages, whenever we tried to resolve the issue by installing the packages that were missing it still wouldn’t work. After much research into the problem via various avenues it was decided that we would on one computer. This wasn’t an issue as it allowed us to work together a lot to get it done in a more timely manner.

The creation of the back end was a really challenging and rewarding process. It was the first time that I had built a RESTful API using ASP.net MVC. This API was built to allow the passing of JSON information and images to the front end android application Pathmapper. We built the application to be as robust and scalable as possible such that other applications could eventually use the information in other projects. Having built a restful API previously in project one and web three, the syntax and general best practices around how an API works and the methods involved in making one was not an issue. We first created some simple GET requests to allow the front end to grab single garden item data. Then once we were confident that this was working correctly we moved on to returning an IEnumerable of a QRPoint, an IEnumerable allowed us to return a JSON encoded array of data members. This was particularly useful in allowing the map in Pathmapper to be populated with markers with the relevant details about that QRPoint (Plant,  Statue etc).  
<br><br><br>
Once we had the ability to do GET requests working perfectly, it was time to tackle the POST requests. We started by creating the front end pages for the API, this would allow an admin to fill out a web form and then the data would be parsed in a controller method to then be inserted into the backend database. This task wasn’t too challenging as myself and Matt had already had a bit of exposure to getting data from a form and posting to a SQL backend server in OOSD.

In week eight, Liam and I were invited to a visual impairment services evening by Dr Mary Butler. The event was held by 3rd year OT students in conjunction with VICTA (Visual Impairment Community Trust Association) and Retina NZ. The aim of the evening was to highlight the lack of funding from the government and the advances made when students and educational institutions work together to provide services to those in need. We were provided a booth to show the visual scan suite application to a range of people, from occupational therapists, to those in the healthcare sector looking at possible tools to aid in the diagnosis of visual impairment following a neurological event. This was the first time that we had shown the application to anyone outside of the development circle. It was a really great experience to show those who would eventually be the users of the application what we had been working on. There was a real interest in the application and we received really positive feedback about what we were doing and how the application looked.
It is always a bit nerve wracking showing your creation to outsiders, unsure of how it will be received and how to essentially “sell” the product to the future users. It was a real test for myself to confidently speak in front of a group of professionals in their field about visual training as I myself am not trained in that area. I believe that I came out of that evening with a real sense of pride for the application that we had created and a new sense of confidence when speaking with those outside of the IT sector. Moving forward into my future employment these skills are invaluable.
<br><br><br>
In week 13 we were fortunate enough to have John Enlow from TracMap come in to take a look at the applications we had created and give us helpful tips that we hadn’t even thought about. In regards to the visual scan suite, he talked about changing the flow of the application from a single test run at a time then saved to a system were the occupational therapist could choose the tests they would like to run then the application would run those apps one after another and produce a report at the end of the tests. If I had more time this is something I would definitely implement, instead I will inform the project one students about this and going forward this could be something that they implement. John also talked to us about the web API and asked some questions around security, these were things that we hadn’t considered as much as we should of, questions around rate limiting and making sure that the passwords were secure. It was really invaluable having him come in to talk with us albeit intimidating. In hindsight it would’ve been nice to have him come in even earlier than he did so we would have had more time to implement his suggestions. Coming out of the meeting I have much more respect for ensuring that anything on the web should have security on the top of the list during development and will take this knowledge into my career.

“””HERE ABOUT THE FEEDBACK FROM THE OT BOYS TESTS”

<br><br><br>
During the duration of project two I have worked with Dr Mary Butler to continue working on the Visual Scan Suite. One thing that I have come to appreciate is how to manage the expectations of an external client and how to be realistic in what is achievable in a given time frame. I believe that I have gained some really good skills in this regard, I have been able to effectively communicate what is possible and what isn’t in a given time frame. This skill will continue with me throughout the rest of my working career and I am grateful that I’ve had the opportunity to practice this skill in a safe environment.
<br><br><br>
This semester of project two I have definitely changed my ways in regards to solving problems, instead of using the unreliable methods of stack overflow and writing substandard code till it works approach. I have read more official documentation this semester than that of last semester, which in my opinion has allowed me to be much more efficient in my ability to fix a bug or tidy up existing code from projects worked on in project one. I in no way consider myself the best programmer but the skills I have obtained this semester definitely point me in the right trajectory to becoming a truly strong and reliable programmer and a worthy employee of any software company.
<br><br><br>
In conclusion, I have truly enjoyed my time in project, working with a great bunch of talented people, sharing ideas and creating truly useful software for those who need it. I will carry throughout the rest of my life the technical and non-technical skills required to be a strong and confident programmer and team member.
