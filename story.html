<h1> Reflective essay</h1>

<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: 'Segoe UI',sans-serif; color: #333333; background: white;">Moving from Project 1 to Project 2 was always going to be a step up. The motivation to ensure that I graduate was always in the front of my mind. I started off the semester ready to roll. Having had a successful first semester of Project gave me a great starting point to project two and I was ready to push myself, be proud of the level of my work, and the professionalism I had achieved during the course of project and the degree as a whole.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: 'Segoe UI',sans-serif; color: #333333;"><br /> <br /> <br /> <span style="background: white;">The Project 2 structure varied quite a bit from that of Project 1 where there was more emphasis on individual learning. This change in structure of the marks was quite different to the usual marking breakdown I had encountered during the degree but nonetheless I was prepared to get it done.&nbsp;</span><br /> <br /> <br /> <span style="background: white;">During the break between semester one and semester two I was offered a job at Agility CIS in Auckland as a Junior Analyst Developer. This alleviated a lot of stress which comes with finding a job for the end of the degree and allowed me to fully focus my time on achieving a high level of work during the duration of the second semester. In saying that, with the acceptance of the job came a few other stresses, such as trying to sort out the whole moving process and finding accommodation in Auckland. Also having accepted the job meant that there was no way I could slack off in any way, shape or form, as part of the deal with accepting a graduate&rsquo;s position is that you must graduate.&nbsp;</span><br /> <br /> <br /> <span style="background: white;">The skills I had accrued during Project 1 and my other earlier papers really helped separate me from the other candidates for the role I am about to take. The ability to talk confidently about my programming abilities in a .NET environment, my knowledge of databases and my ability to work in an agile workflow within a team differentiated me from other candidates and I am truly grateful for the knowledge I have received during the duration of this degree and project.&nbsp;</span><br /> <br /> <br /> <span style="background: white;">The first week of project saw the group expand with the addition of the project one students, having had such a tight knit group from the previous semester I did find it hard at first to adapt to the change of size and level of technical proficiency between the Project 1 members and Project 2 members. An example of the difference in technical proficiency would be when Abdul was tasked with creating a tool for Visual Scan Suite at the start of the semester. This however was a chance to help teach and better my skills when handing over code to another person. Having the ability to adapt to different situations and respond to changes most efficiently is something I have been putting a lot more effort into this semester. I found that when we had issues such as the ERD change up, I was not particularly as frightened as I would of been at the start of the year. I believe that I have grown from the changes. Allowing myself to not only focus on my own personal studies but help others when they have questions and provide any knowledge that may help them has been really good for my growth.&nbsp;</span><br /> <br /> <br /> <span style="background: white;">Throughout this project 2 semester I have had the chance to do a lot of pair programming, I truly believe that the best code and most efficient way of achieving sprint tasks is to pair program. The ability to exchange ideas and thoughts about code as its being written has helped me enormously throughout the last semester, it allowed Matt and I to be on the same page and agree on what was working and what wasn&rsquo;t. One thing I learnt from the pair programming experience was that to successfully pair program you must be confident to have opinions and stand by your abilities. I believe that over the course of the degree I&rsquo;ve become a lot more open to discussion and sharing of tasks which will has enabled me to work together with another person well, and make sure that my voice is heard. Having this skill going forward will enable me to be a better more productive member of a professional workplace.</span><br /> <br /> <br /> In the first few weeks, Matt and I ran into the issue of the ASP.NET API project not loading correctly when working off different computers running different versions of Visual Studio. Usually there would be a quick fix to be found to most problems like this, however none were found. About halfway through the process of trying to find a solution to this problem it was decided that it would be a more effective use of time to just work together off one computer. I took away from this that although in practice the use of version control is important in a team setting, sometimes problems arise where the only real solution is to just get it done together. At the end of the API creation I actually thought of it as a blessing in disguise as we achieved much more than we could of done separately in my opinion. <br /> <br /> <br /> <span style="background: white;">In week eight, Liam and I were invited to a visual impairment services evening by Dr Mary Butler. The event was held by 3rd year OT students in conjunction with VICTA (Visual Impairment Community Trust Association) and Retina NZ. The aim of the evening was to highlight the lack of funding from the government and the advances made when students and educational institutions work together to provide services to those in need. We were provided a booth to show the visual scan suite application to a range of people, from occupational therapists to those in the healthcare sector looking at possible tools to aid in the diagnosis of visual impairment following a neurological event. This was the first time that we had shown the application to anyone outside of the development circle. It was a really great experience to show those who would eventually be the users of the application what we had been working on. There was a real interest in the application and we received really positive feedback about what we were doing and how the application looked. It is always a bit nerve wracking showing your creation to outsiders, unsure of how it will be received and how to essentially &ldquo;sell&rdquo; the product to the future users. It was a real test for myself to confidently speak in front of a group of professionals in their field about visual training as I myself am not trained in that area. I came out of that evening with a real sense of pride for the application that we had created and a new sense of confidence when speaking with those outside of the IT sector. Moving forward into my future employment these skills are invaluable.&nbsp;</span><br /> <br /> <br /> <span style="background: white;">In week 13 we were fortunate enough to have John Enlow from TracMap come in to take a look at the applications we had created and give us helpful tips. He raised many issues that we hadn&rsquo;t even thought about. For the Visual Scan Suite, he talked about changing the flow of the application from single run tests to numerous tests model. At this stage, the occupational therapists run one tool then save the results. John recommended changing to a more user-friendly flow of control, where the user can choose multiple tests before commencing. If I had more time this is something I would implement, Instead I will inform the Project 1 students about this and it could be something that they implement in the future. John also talked to us about the web API and asked some questions around security. These were things that we hadn&rsquo;t considered as much as we should have, questions around rate limiting and making sure that the passwords were secure. It was invaluable having him come in to talk with us albeit intimidating. In hindsight it would have been nice to meet with him even earlier than he did, so we would have had more time to implement his suggestions. After that meeting I have much more respect for ensuring that anything on the web should have security at the forefront of any decisions during development and will take this knowledge into my career.&nbsp;</span><br /> <br /> <br /> <span style="background: white;">In week 14, Liam and I met with two 3rd year occupational therapists who were specialising in visual impairment for their final project. They tested the application with local people who had suffered a stroke. This was the first time that the application had been properly tested with those who will eventually use it and we got some really good feedback from them. They told us that the users really liked the application and it was easy to use, however there were some things that could be improved upon. It was good to have their feedback and finally have some actual user testing completed. One thing that I learnt was how hard it is to get user testing when creating a health based application and something I had not really considered being an issue in the beginning of the development cycle. With Visual Scan Suite being such a specialised tool, it was paramount to get it right in order for it to actually be used in the wider community. The Visual Scan Suite was the first real application that I had made for a truly external client, the mindset during the creation was not one of ensuring that I do everything needed to get marks. I took on the mindset of ensuring that by the end of the degree I had been part of the creation of an application that makes a difference, and would be used by those it was intended for. I'm really proud of what Liam and I have achieved this semester with Visual Scan Suite.&nbsp;</span><br /> <br /> <br /> <span style="background: white;">Throughout Project 2 I have worked with Dr Mary Butler on the Visual Scan Suite. One thing that I have come to appreciate is how to manage the expectations of an external client and how to be realistic in what is achievable in a given time frame. At times, Dr Mary Butler would tend to express an interest in adding as many features as possible as they came to mind. The task for myself was to be polite and listen to the ideas from the client whilst ensuring that these ideas were written down then communicating what was viable to achieve in the following sprints. I believe that I have gained some strong skills in this regard, I have been able to effectively communicate what is possible and what isn&rsquo;t in a professional and courteous manner where previously I would not of felt confident saying no. This skill will continue with me throughout the rest of my working career and I am grateful that I&rsquo;ve had the opportunity to practice this skill in a safe environment.&nbsp;</span><br /> <br /> <br /> <span style="background: white;">This semester of project two I have definitely changed my ways in regard to solving problems. Instead of using the unreliable methods of Stack Overflow, and writing substandard code till it works approach. I have read more official documentation this semester, which has allowed me to be much more efficient in my ability to fix a bug or tidy up existing code from projects worked on in project one. I in no way consider myself the best programmer, but the skills I have obtained this semester point me in the right trajectory to becoming a truly strong and reliable programmer. I have gained a better understanding of ensuring the code I write is modular, well commented and SOLID. I have a greater appreciation for ensuring that all projects I create are architecturally sound, allowing for the projects to be scalable and of professional, production level. I believe these skills will allow me to be a worthy employee of any software company.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: 'Segoe UI',sans-serif; color: #333333; background: white;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: 'Segoe UI',sans-serif; color: #333333;">During this semester I have struggled to document my work as well as I should have. I made sure I commented all my code and verbally conveyed any things I felt were necessary to the relevant team members. There is definitely room for improvement in this area, I can see now how important it is to be vigilant in the creation of documentation throughout the development lifecycle. Going into a job role next year where I know there will be a lot of documentation required I am going to endeavour to be more proactive on this front and not allow myself to fall behind. I acknowledge that this is an area of my work which has room for much improvement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: 'Segoe UI',sans-serif; color: #333333;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: 'Segoe UI',sans-serif; color: #333333;">In the second to last week of the semester we had a showcase of our work. Liam and I showed the most recent version of Visual Scan Suite to the general public for the first time. It was good to see how people interacted with it, there did not seem to be any trouble in using the tools or understanding how to navigate through the application. At showcase it was a great opportunity to talk with people outside of the health sector about the application and its use cases. There were many people who had nice things to say about us working on a health based application and I found myself feeling good about the project as a whole. The morning of showcase was spent ensuring that the application was working correctly on all the tablets we had. There were some bugs that were found when porting the application to the new tablets, However I saw this as a chance to work under a time pressure. I actually found myself really motivated and thinking hard about problems when there was this time pressure, I wouldn&rsquo;t say that I would always like to code under these time pressures, but I am proud of the updates and final touch ups before showcase.<br /> <br /> <br /> <span style="background: white;">In conclusion, I have truly enjoyed my time in project, working with a great bunch of talented people, sharing ideas and creating useful software for those who need it. I will carry throughout the rest of my life the technical and non-technical skills required to be a strong and confident programmer and team member.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
