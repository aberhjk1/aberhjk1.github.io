<h2>1. How often do you attend scheduled group meetings/scrums?</h2>
<br>
<h2>5/5</h2>
<br>
<p> I attended all meetings and scrums over the course of project two. this was really important as with having such a dynamic workflow 
   this semester it was imperative that we were all present to discuss any changes to the sprint outcomes, keeping a solid communication flow going has allowed us to achieve the goals we set out to achieve. I also made sure to go to all meetings with 
  external clients, having numerous meetings with Dr Mary Butler, and Clare Fraser.</p>
