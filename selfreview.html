<h1>Professional proficiency</h1>
<br>
<h2>Question 1. How often do you attend scheduled group meetings/scrums?</h2>

<h2>5/5</h2>
<br>
<p> I attended all meetings and scrums over the course of project two. this was really important as with having such a dynamic workflow 
   this semester it was imperative that we were all present to discuss any changes to the sprint outcomes, keeping a solid communication flow going has allowed us to achieve the goals we set out to achieve. I also made sure to go to all meetings with 
  external clients, having numerous meetings with Dr Mary Butler, and Clare Fraser over the duration of Project 2.
</p>

<h3>Evidence:</h3>
   
 <p>  Throughout the semester, I have been the "go to" person in regards to the Visual Scan Suite, I have enjoyed the chance to improve my professional email writing 
   with an external client and believe I have always shown professionalism in regards to communication with Dr Mary Butler. </p>

<h2>Question 2. How well did you communicate with others in your group or subgroup?</h2>
<br>

<h2>4.5/5</h2>
<br>
<p> I gave myself 4.5 out of 5 for this as although I believe I communicate with people really well, there is always room for improvement. I found that every now and again when I was stressed I would go into my own wee bubble, this is something that I'm trying really hard to stop doing. In saying
   that, this was never to the hindrance of the group and it is more of a personal goal than a lack of communication with others.
   As a team we were very fortunate to have really capable members and everyone was open to ideas and changes which allowed open dialog and in turn, a more stable and robust final product.</p>
<br>
<h3>Evidence:</h3>
<p>
   Another example of good communication practices is the continued use of Slack within the team, Slack is a communication tool used in teams to quickly communicate ideas and share files. As a team we were good at making sure we kept the Slack up to date with the latest
   happenings during the sprints and general information that was needed. Below is an example of how I used Slack during my time as scrum master </p><br><br>

<h2>Question 3. How well did you document your work throughout the project?</h2>
<br>

<h2>4/5</h2>
<br>
<p> The documentation of my work has been something that I feel I didn't do enough of this semester, 
   I was sure to comment any code I wrote and helped write/complete any API Documentation. 
   Alot of the time it was others who took the step to start the documentation writing then I would append my sections to that. There is definitely room for improvement in this area. 
   Going into a job role next year where I know there will be alot of documentation required I am going to endevour to be more proactive on this front.</p>

<br>
<h2>Question 4. How well did you respond to problems or changing requirements?</h2>

<h2>4.5/5</h2>
<br>
<p> The CommSoft group projects went through many iterations and changes over project 2, From having the SQL database ERD completely overhauled, Rewriting the API, Redesigning the Visual Scan Suite to
be usable on a wide range of tablets and PathMapper having the design and user requirements changing constantly. I believe that I handled problems and changes really well, I consider myself very good at being able to adapt and therefore any change in requirements wasn't an issue for me. Working with 
Dr Mary Butler as the main point of contact this semester has taught me how to manage the expectations of an external client and the rollercoaster that comes with the desire for more functionality.
Coming from a managerial background I have had alot of practice in dealing with problems and changing environments. The documentation of the group was also really helpful when having to backtrack or rewrite any code.</p>

<p>The changing of the ERD was decided as the original version wasn't scalable and didn't correctly define the definition of the data that
   we were required to store.
   
   The original ERD was a three table design with an admin table: </p>
   <br>
   <img src="EvidenceImages/firstVersionERD.PNG" alt="First ERD" width="90%"></img><br>
<p>The second ERD was a more complex design which allowed for scalability and correct defined the definition of what we were trying to store, allowing for unique attributes of an item, location data for a collection and image urls for use with the front end android application:

<h1>Technical proficiency</h1>

<h2>Question 1. What is the overall quality of your code like?</h2>

<h2>4.5/5</h2>
<br>
<p> I believe the overall quality of my code has definitely improved from project one going into project two. As my programming knowledge grew from OOSD and ADS
   I had a better understanding of what good code looks like and how to write good code myself. Throughout project two I always tried to follow best practices in regards to the code I wrote
   keeping the SOLID principles at the forefront of anything I wrote. When writing the ASP.net backend API I made sure that all the GET requests methods were modular and had only one responsibility.
   having the ability to work together with Matt during the coding process also helped ensure that any code that was written was up to both our standards.
   
   One example of really clean re-usable code is that of the EncryptionUtilities class in the API. The EncryptionUtilities class is used to encode a password 
   via salting and hashing the password of a user of the API and also decrypt the password of a user when they are trying to login to the API front end.
   This code is re usable with any login system with a backend database as accepts a string password, and returns a salted/hashed password in return using the built in .NET
   RNGCryptoServiceProvider class.</p>
   
   <br>
   <img src="EvidenceImages/hashnsaltmethod.PNG" alt="Hash and Salt method" width="90%"></img><br>

<p>Building on from this code, The Login Method in the AdminController was clear/concise with solid error checking. 
   This method followed the best practices of ASP.net security and general security practices by ensuring that the password entered once decrypted in the EncryptionUtilities class.
</p>
   <br>

<br>
<p>
   Another method that I believe shows good practices is that of the RegisterNewAdmin method. This method allows an admin to register a new admin to the API, this method makes sure that the
   username chosen doesn't already exist in the database ensuring that we have unique users of the API, also have a enter password and reenter password input control as an extra bit of security.

<h3> Third Party QR Code addition</h3>
<br>
<p>
   With the challenge of accurate GPS tracking currently it was decided that QR codes would be a great alternative to allow the user of Pathmapper to 
   find information about garden items. To allow an admin to create these QR codes via the front-end of the API, I was tasked with adding the ability to take the data from a QRPoint
   and returning an image of a QR code that the app would be able to use to load the relevant information about that plant.
   
   writing my own QR code creator was out of scope for this project so I turned to a third party library in order to create the QR codes.
   I researched the different QR code generators available in the Nuget Package manager, and decided that the QRCoder library was the most appropriate for our problem.
   This library is nice and easy to use, practically allowing me to create a QR Code in 5 lines of code.
   <br>
   Below is the code to create a QR Code for a QRPoint using the library:
