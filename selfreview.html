<h1>Professional proficiency</h1>
<br>
<h2>Question 1. How often do you attend scheduled group meetings/scrums?</h2>
<br>
<h2>5/5</h2>
<br>
<p> I attended all meetings and scrums over the course of project two. this was really important as with having such a dynamic workflow 
   this semester it was imperative that we were all present to discuss any changes to the sprint outcomes, keeping a solid communication flow going has allowed us to achieve the goals we set out to achieve. I also made sure to go to all meetings with 
  external clients, having numerous meetings with Dr Mary Butler, and Clare Fraser.</p>


<br>
<h2>Question 2. How well did you communicate with others in your group or subgroup?</h2>
<br>
<h2>4.5/5</h2>
<br>
<p> I gave myself 4.5 out of 5 for this as although I believe I communicate with people really well, there is always room for improvement. I found that every now and again when I was stressed I would go into my own wee bubble, this is something that I'm trying really hard to stop doing. In saying
   that, this was never to the hindrance of the group and it is more of a personal goal than a lack of communication with others.
   As a team we were very fortunate to have really capable members and everyone was open to ideas and changes which allowed open dialog and in turn, a more stable and robust final product.</p>

<br>
<h2>Question 3. How well did you document your work throughout the project?</h2>
<br>
<h2>3.5/5</h2>
<br>
<p> The documentation of my work has been something that I feel I didn't do enough of this semester, I was sure to comment any code I wrote and helped write/complete any API Documentation. Alot of the time it was others who took the step to start the documentation writing then I would append my sections to that. There is definitely room for improvement in this area. 
   Going into a job role next year where I know there will be alot of documentation required I am going to endevour to be more proactive on this front.</p>
