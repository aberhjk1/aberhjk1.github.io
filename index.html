	<h1>Hi there, I'm Jordan Aberhart!</h1>
	
	
	
<p>	Overview
This year in project we are building several applications to help people who suffer from visual impairment after a stroke. This covers a wide range of problems to assess and aid in the recovery of their vision. The app allows patients to train their eye in various challenges using tablet-based visual simulation exercises after leaving the hospital. Our other main project is the Dunedin Botanical Garden Android application. The app consists of a dynamic map, shows the visitor's location, provides information about important park elements and It allows visitors of the Dunedin Botanical Gardens to have a more interactive experience whilst visiting the gardens, and also allows the botanical gardens to monitor which areas of the gardens are most popular. We have been preparing for these projects by completing a set of tasks to develop the necessary skillset. This skillset will allow us to implement our two projects efficiently.. I set out in this project believing it would be easy to complete these tasks in the given time, however with the additional workload of my other papers I have found it to be not as easy as initially thought. The ability to manage time efficiently has been key to completing the given tasks on time, and maintaining effective communication between the project manager (Patricia) and the other members of the team has been imperative. 
Communication
The main obstacle to a successful project team is the ability to have effective communication between team members. At the start of the course, most of the projects or assignments I had worked on were individual learning tasks. This meant that there was limited communication required with others and less reliance on others completing work. This is the inverse of working with a group of people, as it is paramount to keep the communication flowing with others. Clear communication lets everyone know what is currently being completed and what needs to be done. Making the effort to communicate with others in the group allows us to all be on the same playing field when it comes to achieving our goals. It is also important to make sure that everyone sufficiently understands what is happening rather than each member of the team only being aware of his own part of the work.  This ensures that;
1. Tasks are not being done multiple times by different group members. This has meant that we could be all working on individual tasks of an overall project which could then be put together into a final project. 
2. Everyone knows their tasks and the direction of the group, and if this changes it can be communicated through all group members
I believe that we have achieved an appropriate level of communication within our group. The use of Slack to communicate ideas and actions within our project has been essential to our success in the sprints we have had. Each team member has been consistent and vocal on this forum, allowing us to be efficient and cohesive as a large development team. I have learnt from previous experience that it is easy for a project to fall apart quickly if there is a lack of communication for any amount of time. Even if it doesn’t seem like an important thing to communicate, it is better to let everyone know than to keep things to yourself. This has had an impact on the way I have communicated with others in a positive way, as I have made a more concerted effort to be consistent in my communication. Coming from a managerial background I have always known the importance of communication, but I have had to realise that it is not the same when people are in the same building working together as when people are working remotely as part of a larger group coming together to put together a cohesive piece of software. 
 
Slack communication within the team
Another effective means of communication that was relatively new to me was the idea of “stand ups”. A stand-up is a short, frequent meeting between team members where each member.....I had touched on the idea of stand ups in Software engineering however my previous group never executed them properly. Being consistent in holding stands up on a Wednesday and Friday has allowed our team to always be on the right track, enabling us to talk about any issues we have faced, any breakthroughs we have had, and to communicate what we plan on doing. During my time as scrum master (team leader; a rotating position) it was my responsibility to ask each member of the team what he had done since we had last met, and what he is planning on doing before the next meeting. I found this a helpful approach to keeping the project and the individual members of the team focused on the tasks that needed to be achieved. It also gave me more confidence in talking and responding to a group of people in a constructive manner.
During this time, I have had the chance to communicate with Dr. Mary Butler (the client for the visual scan suite) and have learnt how to write formal emails as appropriate in a professional context... These emails were fundamental as they facilitated communication with the client, and allowed us to set up external meetings. The meetings with the client ensured that we were all on the same pageand had a clear idea of her vision for the project. 
In these face-to-face client meetings, I learned that it was important to use language that was understandable to the client. This was a new concept for me as previously I was accustomed to talking with my classmates or lecturers, and using technical jargon rather than common vocabulary.. Overall, I believe my interaction with Dr Butler has greatly improved my ability to communicate in a formal way with clients, and I now feel less intimidated by this task..

Planning
During this semester, I have significantly improved my approach to software development. I had originally assumed that I could write a piece of software from scratch without properly documenting and planning the steps I would take to do so. I soon found out that this approach is ineffective, an example of this was when I created a JavaScript web application in my web class and got to the nearly the end and found out my architecture wouldn’t support the task that was given. Therefore now, instead I thought about how I could more efficiently use my time to plan effectively, and therefore achieve a superior result. I made sure that each major sprint task was properly split into smaller, achievable sub-tasks that made logical sense. I found this increased my productivity as it wasn’t so daunting to complete the major sprint task as it had been split up into more achievable sized tasks that could be assigned throughout the group. An example of this was when during the Kiwiana cardboard project. This was split into parts that allowed it to be completed faster than anticipated. We assigned some of the team to work on gathering of images, some to research the logic of working with sensors and the rest to work on implementing the VR surface holder. 
By researching the relevant official documentation before starting the project, I was able to  begin the project with a good base knowledge of the design principles of cardboard applications, and the correct class design for building them. In previous projects I had taken a slower, less efficient approach of using  online tutorials and YouTube videos as my starting point.. I now realise this isn’t the best way of going about it as it doesn’t allow you to fully understand the code and reasoning behind doing things a certain way. One facet of planning that I decided to implement in my personal work is the practice of writing out on paper any classes, models and logical problems I may face before I started coding. This meant that when I do start coding the application I have a good starting point for the project. 
Time Management
Time management has been crucial to the success of each sprint we have done so far. (A sprint is a defined time frame in which we must complete a specific set of tasks.. This semester, our sprints have lasted wither two or three weeks. ) At the beginning of the semester I quit my job so I could be more available to the group and have more time to focus on the papers I have taken. This is because it is the first time over the course of this degree that I personally have had to spend a lot of time outside of lectures so I could finish projects and tasks. In the previous years of the degree I could get away with showing up to the lectures and completing the necessary work in only 15-20 hours of class a week, as well as working a near full time job outside of class.  But this semester, I found it hard to find a healthy balance between doing class assigned work and personal life. I found myself becoming stressed by the workload given in my other papers and the small timeframes in which to fulfil these tasks. I quickly realised that I needed to put a system in place where I had set hours for class work. This meant that I treated my class work as a “9-5” job working 40 hours a week minimum, where I would come in to class early and leave when I felt I had achieved my goals for the day. I have found myself to be far more proactive and happier knowing that I am achieving my goals during the day and that gave me more time to spend with friends and family during the evening. I have also made it a habit to come into campus during the weekend for a few hours to catch up on anything I may have been behind in or to get a step ahead of where I needed to be. Writing down my goals as a list of things I need to check off before I leave for the day has helped me to get things done on time. In terms of project, the use of a Kanban board has been crucial to our successful time management and success in sprints. Our group has used Trello to manage our tasks into reasonable sized chunks. Trello allows us to keep track of where we are at during sprints, what’s currently in progress, what is completed, and what still needs to be done.
 
Community Software Trello Board
I soon came to the conclusion that I was more efficient at completing tasks if I came onto campus instead of working from home. I found that when I was working from home I became too easily distracted or lacked the motivation to do as much work as I should be doing. I also found that having two screens on campus and an allocated workspace without any distractions allowed me to complete set tasks more quickly than if I was at home.
Tasks
There were four main sprint tasks that we were required to complete this semester. These included: creating a C# application to display JSON data that had been retrieved from a remote web service, creating a Django RESTful API to serve JSON data from a back-end relational database, creating a Kiwiana-based Google Cardboard project using an Android cell phone, and preparing this portfolio. 
Challenge 1
Using voice recognition in an android application without having the voice input dialog box show up whilst in cardboard mode, allowing the user to change images through the use of sound. Allowing for a more immersive experience.
Evidence
VrPanoViewer in production branch
CommSoftTasks/VrPanoViewer/app/src/main/java/bit/harrl7/vrdemo/SimpleVrPanoramaActivity.java
Research Method
I researched both Native and 3rd Party libraries for voice recognition,
Sources include:
https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/SpeechRecognizer.html 
https://cmusphinx.github.io/wiki/tutorialandroid/
I researched external libraries for “always listening” background voice recognition and found pocketSphinx,
Pocket Sphinx: https://github.com/cmusphinx/pocketsphinx
The third-party libraries that implement always-listening capabilities were too tricky to implement due to my lack of knowledge with integrating 3rd party libraries at that stage in the semester. I also found the documentation inadequate. Thus, I decided that it was most suitable to use the native android library.
What I Implemented
I chose to implement voice recognition with the native android Speech Recognizer class. I made the Activity that was responsible for the panoramic images to implement Speech Recognizer. This allowed me to write override methods to make sure that the dialog box didn’t pop up. An example of the relevant code is shown below:
When the user speaks the word “next”  the app displays the next image in the slideshow.
In order to implement this functionality, I first added permissions to the project to record audio in the Android Manifest. Since the application had a minimum SDK set to 19, this allowed me to use an older, simpler Android permissions model. . At the time of implementing this functionality I hadn’t learnt fully about the new permissions model, so I didn’t feel comfortable implementing it. Now after learning the new way Android permissions model in class, I feel confident I could update the application..
 
Android documentation regarding RECORD_AUDIO and its protection level.

What I Learnt
From this challenge, I learnt that the android speech recognition class is a powerful and accurate tool to use if you want to implement voice recognition capabilities in an application. The architecture is identical to other Android patterns for adding event handlers, e.g. onClickListeners, where you create an inner class and bind the listener to a view.
I would like to explore this voice recognition class further and try to get it to listen “all the time”, as the current implementation stops listening after the event is fired. This however comes with its own challenges that would require more thought, such as using a lot of bandwidth on the users’ device, as well as being taxing on the battery of the users’ device.
Challenge 2
Using the magnetometer with the magnet on the Google Cardboard V1 to change images (like a View Master).
Evidence
VrPanoViewer in production branch
Research Method
I began by exploring the documentation on the Android developers website regarding sensors and magnetic fields. I found that the use of magnets was deprecated on the Google Cardboard because of its unreliability. 
What I Implemented
 Because of these problems with the Cardboard magnet control, I chose to implement a Sensor Manager. This meant utilising the sensor value of the phone's magnetometer. The magnetometer fires when the user changes the orientation of the phone (in this case by lowering his gaze to the floor). We  used these values to determine when to change the image.
One drawback of this approach was that not all phones have a magnetometer in them, and the magnetic difference would vary between devices and orientations therefore not allowing us to confidently implement this feature across multiple devices. 
What I Learnt
From this I learnt that the reason that Google changed the Cardboard magnet was that the original approach wasn’t reliable enough with the wide range of android devices. We tried incorporating a calibration screen before the user viewed the images, but the range of values and differences between devices made it near impossible. In the end, the changing of images using the magnet was limited to only our Samsung S3, as it became apparent that the differences in magnet values were too extreme that it wouldn’t be plausible to use as a reliable means of changing images.
In addition to this, I learnt that android makes it relatively simple to programmatically get the values off the hardware of a device using the Sensor Manager class.

Challenge 3
Writing a C# app that pulls data from the DigitalNZ API
Evidence
Digital NZ App in Production branch
Research Method
First I researched how the Digital NZ API returns data and in what format. I then looked at how to format the URL request to Digital NZ to get the required response. Foll I signed up for a digital NZ API key via their website, and then looked at HttpWebRequest in C# to see how to perform a GET request for the JSON data needed.
What I Implemented
I used the HttpWebRequest object in C#, with the correct base URL query parameters to retrieve the JSON. I then parsed the JSON and stored the data in a user-defined class instance that matched the properties of the JSON object.  I then output the data into a DataGridView, that presenting it in a tidy, readable manner with clickable links and images that were pulled from a separate Http request.
What I Learnt
Through this process, I learnt that you can make requests to a remote web service via its API and get data back from it to then use as you please. This is a particularly useful skill as there are many APIs from which you can retrieve data. making this invaluable for future projects. I also learnt that many APIs require you to sign up and get an API key to make sure you aren’t overloading their system..
Having never really touched JSON or APIs, this task inspired me to delve deeper into the power of backend APIs and how I could use them in my personal and class projects to produce applications utilising data that I could never collect myself. Learning about JSON and its format and abilities has been instrumental to my learning this semester as the use of JSON has spanned all my papers, and become such a big part of my projects as of late. Self-learning how JSON works before having it assigned it all my other papers has allowed me to be ahead of the curve this semester which has been of great benefit to me.
Challenge 4
Hosting Django Restful API on pythonanywhere.com
Evidence
CommSoft.pythonanywhere.com
Research Method
I began by completing a tutorial on how to deploy onto pythonanywhere.com. I then signed up to pythonanywhere.com to enable me to deploy our Django restful API on the site.
What I Implemented
I began by working through the tutorial on the pythonanywhere website, but I found it hard to follow. Fortunately, one of my other team members had quite a bit of experience with servers, and put together a comprehensive document which I followed to push our production code up to the server hosted on pythonanywhere.com. We were then able to use this with our C# or android application to pull JSON formatted data from our Django RESTful API for future projects with the Botanical garden.
What I learnt
From this I learnt how to set up a pythonanywhere account and how to use the bash console. This was the first time I had ever put an API onto a server that was accessible anywhere. I found it really exciting to see all of our work available to use online by other applications. This task also strengthened my ability to use git beyond the normal use of adding, committing and pushing. This skill is vital in the age of version control and I am always looking to better myself in the use of this tool. It was exciting to then deploy something from local development e.g. Localhost to a live web server which could be used to pull JSON data from and add to via external application. I also learnt that there are limitations to hosting on pythonanywhere, as a free user we were limited to 90 days of hosting before we had to renew the service. This however can be overcome by simply checking up on the service every three months and clicking “Run until 3 months from today”, allowing unlimited time hosting the API as a free user.
