    location, provides information about important park elements and It allows
    visitors of the Dunedin Botanical Gardens to have a more interactive
    experience whilst visiting the gardens, and also allows the botanical
    gardens to monitor which areas of the gardens are most popular. We have
    been preparing for these projects by completing a set of tasks to develop
    the necessary <a>skillset</a>

    . I set out in this project believing it would be easy to complete these
    tasks in the given time, however with the additional workload of my other
    papers I have found it to be <a>no</a>t as easy as initially thought. The
    ability to manage time efficiently has been key to completing the given
    tasks on time, and maintaining effective communication between the project
manager (Patricia) and the other members of the team has been    <a>imperative</a>

<h1>
    <a name="_Toc483162660">Communication</a>
</h1>
<p>
    The main obstacle to a successful project team is the ability to have
    effective communication between team members. At the start of the course,
    most of the projects or assignments I had worked on were individual
    learning tasks. This meant that there was limited communication required
    with others and less reliance on others completing work. This is the
    inverse of working with a group of people, as it is paramount to keep the
    communication flowing with others. Clear communication lets everyone know
    what is currently being completed and what needs to be <a>done</a>
    <a
        id="_anchor_7"
        href="file:///H:/jordan%20portfolio%20commented.docx#_msocom_7"
        name="_msoanchor_7"
    >
        [PH7]
    </a>
    . Making the effort to communicate with others in the group allows us to
    all be on the same playing field when it comes to achieving our goals. It
    is also important to make sure that everyone sufficiently understands what
is happening rather than each member of the team only being aware of    <a>his</a>
    <a
        id="_anchor_8"
        href="file:///H:/jordan%20portfolio%20commented.docx#_msocom_8"

    </a>
    own part of the work. This ensures that;
</p>
<p>
    1. Tasks are not being done multiple times by different group members. This
    has meant that we could be all working on individual tasks of an overall
    project which could then be put together into a final project.
</p>
<p>
    2. Everyone knows their tasks and the direction of the group, and if this
    changes it can be communicated through all group members
</p>
<p>
    I believe that we have achieved an appropriate level of communication
    within our group. The use of Slack to communicate ideas and actions within
    our project has been <a>essential</a>
    <a
        id="_anchor_9"
        href="file:///H:/jordan%20portfolio%20commented.docx#_msocom_9"
        name="_msoanchor_9"
    >
        [PH9]
    </a>
    to our success in the sprints we have had. Each team member has been
    consistent and vocal on this forum, allowing us to be efficient and
    cohesive as a large development team. I have learnt from previous
    experience that it is easy for a project to fall apart quickly if there is
    a lack of communication for any amount of time. Even if it doesn’t seem
    like an important thing to communicate, it is better to let everyone know
    than to keep things to yourself. This has had an impact on the way I have
    communicated with others in a positive way, as I have made a more concerted
    effort to be consistent in my communication. Coming from a managerial
    background I have always known the importance of communication, but I have
    had to realise that it is not the same when people are in the same building
    working together as when people are working remotely as part of a larger
    group coming together to put together a cohesive piece of software.

    Slack communication within the team
</p>
<p>
    Another effective means of communication that was relatively new to me was
    the idea of “stand <a>ups</a>

    </a>
    stand-up is a short, frequent meeting between team members where each
    member.....I had touched on the idea of stand ups in Software engineering
    however my previous group never executed them properly. Being consistent in
    holding stands up on a Wednesday and Friday has allowed our team to always
    be on the right track, enabling us to talk about any issues we have faced,
    any breakthroughs we have <a>had</a>
    <a
        id="_anchor_12"

, and to communicate what we plan on doing. During my time as scrum    <a>master</a>
    <a
        id="_anchor_13"
        href="file:///H:/jordan%20portfolio%20commented.docx#_msocom_13"

        [PH13]
    </a>
    (team leader; a rotating position) it was my responsibility to ask each
    member of the team what he had done since we had last met, and what he is
    planning on doing before the next meeting. I found this a helpful approach
    to keeping the project and the individual members of the team focused on
    the tasks that needed to be achieved. It also gave me more confidence in
    talking and responding to a group of people in a constructive manner.
</p>
<p>
    During this time, I have had the chance to communicate with Dr. Mary Butler
    (the client for the visual scan suite) and have learnt how to write formal
emails as appropriate in a professional context... These emails were    <a>fundamental</a>
    <a
        id="_anchor_14"
        href="file:///H:/jordan%20portfolio%20commented.docx#_msocom_14"

as they facilitated communication with the client, and allowed us to set up    <a>external </a>
    <a
        id="_anchor_15"
        href="file:///H:/jordan%20portfolio%20commented.docx#_msocom_15"
        name="_msoanchor_15"
    >
        [PH15]
    </a>
    meetings. The meetings with the client ensured that we were all on the same
    pageand had a clear idea of her vision for the <a>project</a>
    <a
        id="_anchor_16"
        href="file:///H:/jordan%20portfolio%20commented.docx#_msocom_16"
        name="_msoanchor_16"
    >
        [PH16]
    </a>
    .
</p>
<p>
    In these face-to-face client meetings, I learned that it was important to
    use language that was understandable to the client. This was a new concept
    for me as previously I was accustomed to talking with my classmates or
    lecturers, and using technical jargon rather than common vocabulary..
    Overall, I believe my interaction with Dr Butler has greatly improved my
    ability to communicate <a>in</a>

<h1>
    <a name="_Toc483162661">Planning</a>
</h1>
<p>
    During this semester, I have significantly improved my approach to software
    development. I had originally assumed that I could write a piece of
    software from scratch without properly documenting and planning the steps I
would take to do so. I soon found out that this approach is    <a>ineffective</a>
    <a
        id="_anchor_18"
        href="file:///H:/jordan%20portfolio%20commented.docx#_msocom_18"

    </a>
    , an example of this was when I created a JavaScript web application in my
    web class and got to the nearly the end and found out my architecture
    wouldn’t support the task that was given. Therefore now, instead I thought
    about how I could more efficiently use my time to plan effectively, and
    therefore achieve a superior result. I made <a>sure</a>
    <a
        id="_anchor_19"

    that each major sprint task was properly split into smaller, achievable
    sub-tasks that made logical sense. I found this increased my productivity
    as it wasn’t so daunting to complete the major sprint task as it had been
    split up into more achievable sized tasks that could be assigned throughout
    the group. An example of this was when during the Kiwiana cardboard
    project. This was split into parts that allowed it to be completed faster
    than <a>anticipated</a>
    <a
        id="_anchor_20"

    . We assigned some of the team to work on gathering of images, some to
    research the logic of working with sensors and the rest to work on
    implementing the VR surface holder.
</p>
<p>
    By researching the relevant official documentation before starting the
    project, I was able to begin the project with a good base knowledge of the
    design principles of cardboard applications, and the correct class design
    for building them. In previous <a>projects</a>

    I had taken a slower, less efficient approach of using online tutorials and
    YouTube videos as my starting point.. I now realise this isn’t the best way
    of going about it as it doesn’t allow you to fully understand the code and
    reasoning behind doing things a certain way. One facet of planning that I
    decided to implement in my personal work is the practice of writing out on
    paper any classes, models and logical problems I may face before I started
coding. This meant that when I do start coding the application I    <a>have</a>

    a good starting point for the project.

<h1>
    <a name="_Toc483162662">Time Management</a>
</h1>
<p>
    Time management has been crucial to the success of each sprint we have done
    so far. (A sprint is a defined time frame in which we must complete a
    specific set of tasks.. This semester, our sprints have lasted wither two
    or three weeks. ) At the beginning of the semester I quit my job so I could
    be more available to the group and have more time to focus on the papers I
    have taken. This is because it is the first time over the course of this
    degree that I personally have had to spend a lot of time outside of
    lectures so I could finish projects and tasks. In the previous years of the
    degree I could get away with showing up to the lectures and completing the
    necessary work in only 15-20 hours of class a week, as well as working a
    near full time job outside of class. But this semester, I found it hard to
    find a healthy balance between doing class assigned work and personal life.
    I found myself becoming stressed by the workload given in my other papers
    and the small timeframes in which to fulfil these tasks. I quickly realised
    that I needed to put a system in place where I had set hours for class
    work. This meant that I treated my class work as a “9-5” job working 40
    hours a week minimum, where I would come in to class early and leave when I
    felt I had achieved my goals for the day. I have found myself to be far
    more proactive and happier knowing that I am achieving my goals during the
    day and that gave me more time to spend with friends and family during the
    evening. I have also made it a habit to come into campus during the weekend
for a few hours to catch up on anything    <a>I may have been behind in or to get a step ahead</a>
    <a
        id="_anchor_23"
        href="file:///H:/jordan%20portfolio%20commented.docx#_msocom_23"

    >
        [PH23]
    </a>
    of where I needed to be. Writing down my goals as a list of things I need
    to check off before I leave for the day has helped me to get things done on
    time. In terms of project, the use of a Kanban board has been crucial to
    our successful time management and success in sprints. Our group has used
    Trello to manage our tasks into reasonable sized chunks. Trello allows us
    to keep track of where we are at during sprints, what’s currently in
    progress, what is completed, and what still needs to be done.

</p>
<p>
    I soon came to the conclusion that I was more efficient at completing tasks
    if I came onto campus instead of working from home. I found that when I was
    working from home I became too easily distracted or lacked the motivation
    to do as much work as I should be doing. I also found that having two
    screens on campus and an allocated workspace without any distractions
    allowed me to complete set tasks more quickly than if I was at home.

    due to my lack of knowledge with integrating 3<sup>rd</sup> party libraries
    at that stage in the semester. I also found the documentation inadequate.
    Thus, I decided that it was most suitable to use the native android
    library.
</p>
<h2>
    <a name="_Toc483162667">What I Implemented</a>
</h2>
<p>
    I chose to implement voice recognition with the native android Speech
    Recognizer class. I made the Activity that was responsible for the
    panoramic images to implement Speech Recognizer. This allowed me to write
override methods to make sure that the dialog box didn’t pop <a></a>    <a>up</a>

    “next” the app displays the next image in the slideshow.
</p>
<p>
    In order to implement this functionality, I first added permissions to the
    project to record audio in the Android Manifest. Since the application had
    a minimum SDK set to 19, this allowed me to use an older, simpler Android
    permissions model. . At the time of implementing this functionality I
    hadn’t learnt fully about the new permissions model, so I didn’t feel
    comfortable implementing it. Now after learning the new way Android
    permissions model in class, I feel confident I could update the
    application..

    <a name="_Toc483162668">What I Learnt</a>
</h2>
<p>
    From this challenge, I learnt that the android speech recognition class is
    a powerful and accurate tool to use if you want to implement voice
    recognition capabilities in an application. The architecture is identical
    to other <a>Android</a>
    <a
        id="_anchor_31"

        [PH31]
    </a>
    patterns for adding event handlers, e.g. onClickListeners, where you create
    an inner class and bind the listener to a view.
</p>
<p>
    I would like to explore this voice recognition class further and try to get
    it to listen “all the time”, as the current implementation stops listening
    after the event is <a>fired</a>

    . This however comes with its own challenges that would require more
    thought, such as using a lot of bandwidth on the users’ device, as well as
    being taxing on the battery of the users’ device.

</h2>
<p>
    I began by exploring the documentation on the Android developers website
    regarding sensors and magnetic fields. I found that the use of magnets was
    deprecated on the Google Cardboard because of its <a>unreliability</a>

    .
</p>
<h2>
    <a name="_Toc483162672">What I Implemented</a>
</h2>
<p>
    Because of these problems with the Cardboard magnet control, I chose to
    implement a Sensor Manager. This meant utilising the sensor value of the
    phone's magnetometer.

    </a>
    The magnetometer fires when the user changes the orientation of the phone
    (in this case by lowering his gaze to the floor). We used these values to
    determine when to change the image.
</p>
<p>
    One drawback of this approach was that not all phones have a magnetometer
in them, and the magnetic difference would vary between devices and orientations
    therefore not allowing us to confidently implement this feature across
    multiple devices.
</p>
<h2>
    <a name="_Toc483162673">What I Learnt</a>
</h2>
<p>
    From this I learnt that the reason that Google changed the Cardboard magnet
    was that the original approach wasn’t reliable enough with the wide range
    of android devices. We tried incorporating a calibration screen before the
    user viewed the images, but the range of values and differences between
    devices made it near impossible. In the end, the changing of images using
    the magnet was limited to only our Samsung S3, as it became apparent that
    the differences in magnet values were too extreme that it wouldn’t be
    plausible to use as a reliable means of changing images.
</p>
<p>
    In addition to this, I learnt that android makes it relatively simple to
    programmatically get the values off the hardware of a device using the
    Sensor Manager class.

    Writing a C# app that pulls data from the DigitalNZ API

    Digital NZ App in Production branch

<h2>
    <a name="_Toc483162676">Research Method</a>
</h2>
<p>
    First I researched how the Digital NZ API returns data and in what format.
    I then looked at how to format the URL request to Digital NZ to get the
    required response. Foll I signed up for a digital NZ API key via their
    website, and then looked at HttpWebRequest in C# to see how to perform a
    GET request for the JSON data needed.
</p>
<h2>
    <a name="_Toc483162677">What I Implemented</a>
</h2>
<p>
    I used the HttpWebRequest object in C#, with the correct base URL query
    parameters to retrieve the JSON. I then parsed the JSON and stored the data
    in a user-defined class instance that matched the properties of the JSON
    object. I then output the data into a DataGridView, that presenting it in a
    tidy, readable manner with clickable links and images that were pulled from
    a separate Http request.
</p>
<h2>
    <a name="_Toc483162678">What I Learnt</a>
</h2>
<p>
    Through this process, I learnt that you can make requests to a remote web
    service via its API and get data back from it to then use as you please.
    This is a particularly useful skill as there are many APIs
    from which you can retrieve data. making this invaluable for future
    projects. I also learnt that many APIs require you to sign up and get an
    API key to make sure you aren’t overloading their system..
</p>
<p>
    Having never really touched JSON or APIs, this task inspired me to delve
    deeper into the power of backend APIs and how I could use them in my
    personal and class projects to produce applications utilising data that I
    could never collect myself. Learning about JSON and its format and
    abilities has been instrumental to my learning this semester as the use of
    JSON has spanned all my papers, and become such a big part of my projects
    as of late. Self-learning how JSON works before having it assigned it all
    my other papers has allowed me to be ahead of the curve this semester which
    has been of great benefit to me.

    Hosting Django Restful API on pythonanywhere.com

    I began by completing a tutorial on how to deploy onto pythonanywhere.com.
    I then signed up to pythonanywhere.com to enable me to deploy our Django
    restful API on the site.
</p>
<h2>
    <a name="_Toc483162682">What I Implemented</a>
</h2>
<p>
    I began by working through the tutorial on the pythonanywhere website, but
    I found it hard to follow. Fortunately, one of my other team members had quite a bit of experience with servers, and
    put together a comprehensive document which I followed to push our
    production code up to the server hosted on pythonanywhere.com. We were then
    able to use this with our C# or android application to pull JSON formatted data from
    our Django RESTful API for future projects with the Botanical garden.
</p>
<h2>
    <a name="_Toc483162683">What I learnt</a>
</h2>
<p>
    From this I learnt how to set up a pythonanywhere account and how to use
    the bash console. This was the first time I had ever put an API onto a
    server that was accessible anywhere. I found it really exciting to see all
    of our work available to use online by other applications. This task also
    strengthened my ability to use git beyond the normal use of adding,
    committing and pushing. This skill is vital in the age of version control
    and I am always looking to better myself in the use of this tool. It was
    exciting to then deploy something from local development e.g. Localhost to
    a live web server which could be used to pull JSON data from and add to via
    external application. I also learnt that there are limitations to hosting
    on pythonanywhere, as a free user we were limited to 90 days of hosting
    before we had to renew the service. This however can be overcome by simply checking up on the service every
    three months and clicking “Run until 3 months from today”, allowing
    unlimited time hosting the API as a free user.
