<p>
  I was lucky enough to be part of the Community Software Group for project. This group takes software requests from the Community from people who cannot afford to pay for a Software Development company. Project 2 has been focused around 3 major tasks:

Creating a SQL Database, and an API to access that information for the Pathmapper app.
Creating Pathmapper. An Android application for the Dunedin Botanical Gardens.
Continuing with the Visual Scan Tool from Project 1
I was heavily involved with both the backend and frontend development for Pathmapper. This was an incredibily interesting project as there was a large amount of complexity with everything we worked on. The Community Software group collaberated well to continiously produce excellent results.
